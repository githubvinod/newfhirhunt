To realize this vision, there is an urgent need to improve the reproducibility and interpretability of the underlying phenotype models and algorithms through a standards-based framework. The Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (<span title="FHIR® is the registered trademark of HL7 and is used with the permission of HL7">FHIR<sup>®</sup></span>) standard was developed to meet a variety of clinical interoperability needs. In this showcase session, we will demonstrate a <span title="FHIR® is the registered trademark of HL7 and is used with the permission of HL7">FHIR<sup>®</sup></span>-based clinical data normalization pipeline known as NLP2<span title="FHIR® is the registered trademark of HL7 and is used with the permission of HL7">FHIR<sup>®</sup></span> developed at the Mayo Clinic and an application of this pipeline to perform EHR-based phenotyping. As a case study, we applied the NLP2<span title="FHIR® is the registered trademark of HL7 and is used with the permission of HL7">FHIR<sup>®</sup></span> to the task of identifying the presence of obesity and 15 of its comorbidities in a given patient from their semi-structured discharge summary. We demonstrate the value of the NLP2<span title="FHIR® is the registered trademark of HL7 and is used with the permission of HL7">FHIR<sup>®</sup></span> in enabling precise clinical data capturing and making EHR-based patient identifications more reproducible and interpretable.
