The HSPC Bilirubin Risk Chart is a SMART on <span title="FHIR® is the registered trademark of HL7 and is used with the permission of HL7">FHIR<sup>®</sup></span> app based on Intermountain Healthcare’s HELP2 Bilirubin app. This app is for demonstration purposes only and is not approved for clinical use. It was created to highlight the concept of the HSPC model, which creates a method of sharing clinical apps currently locked up in a single organization or EHR vendor and make it available to all healthcare providers.

Jaundice occurs in most newborn infants. Most jaundice is benign, but because of the potential toxicity of bilirubin, newborn infants must be monitored to identify those who might develop severe hyperbilirubinemia and, in rare cases, acute bilirubin encephalopathy or Kernicterus. Although kernicterus should almost always be preventable, cases continue to occur. The focus of this app is to reduce the incidence of severe hyperbilirubinemia and bilirubin encephalopathy while minimizing the risks of unintended harm such as maternal anxiety, decreased breastfeeding, and unnecessary costs or treatment.

By overlaying bilirubin \[Mass/volume\] results over a time-based risk chart, clinicians are presented with a visual representation of the results and associated criticality zones. By viewing the results in this way, the clinician can determine the best course of action based on the recommended intervention for the criticality of the result.
