A tool that searches a patient's medical history for reversible causes of PEA arrest. Great for hospital based code teams who often know little about the patient when they arrive. Specifically if searches for history of ESRD, pulmonary embolism, and heart attack. It also pulls the last lab values for potassium, bicarb, pH, etc and orders with links to possible treatments.

The labs do not show up on when you "Try App" as it only searches for last 72 hours. Most of the labs in the sandbox are not resulted in the last 72 hours.

Test patient Sharon Green works best (she has a history of heart attack).
