<div><div>Interpreting blood pressure measurements for children is complicated by the need to account for a constantly changing body size. It is time-consuming to calculate and/or do data entry, yet assessment of blood pressure percentiles is medically recommended from the age of 3 onward because 75% of cases of pediatric hypertension and 90% of cases of prehypertension in children from 3 to 18 years of age go undetected.

The BP Centiles app reads a child’s relevant vitals and calculates systolic and diastolic blood pressure percentiles normalized by age, sex, and height The app also includes a pop-up calculator and a graphical history of the child's blood pressure percentile, enabling full screening at each visit.

Color coding reveals at a glance whether individual readings are normal (green), prehypertensive (yellow), hypertensive (red) or hypotensive (blue). Users can zoom in on a group of readings for more information and apply various filters to help them interpret the measurements—such as looking only at BPs measured in the legs, sitting down or by machine.

BP Centiles was developed in collaboration with Interopion.
