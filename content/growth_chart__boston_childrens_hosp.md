The purpose of this app is to manage and display statistical data for the patients in a few different ways. The data is retrieved from SMART, but depending on the SMART server version, you may also be able edit the records or new ones.There are three ways of representing the data – as charts, as table and the so called Parental View, which is intended for the parents of the child, or. for people that does not have in-depth medical knowledge.The most complex of those views is the charts view because it provides unique set of features:

- It can display multiple charts together, keeping them well ordered, no matter what the data is.
- It has “time navigation” and even a zoom feature, allowing you to move in different portions of the data.
- It can display three types of data together (the patient measurements plus up to two data sets). This allows you to compare the patient data with some statistical average.
- It has an interactive selection, meaning that you can click somewhere on the canvas to select a point in time and see the details about the records near that time. You can also move the mouse over another point(s) and compare them with the current selection.
