Cardiac Consultant is a user-friendly tool which helps doctors educate patients about their individual risk for heart disease and stroke.

Tragically, heart attacks, strokes and other heart diseases account for 1 in 3 deaths overall in the United States. However, many of these deaths can be prevented with better patient education and engagement, and thatâs where Asymmetrik hopes to make a difference.

Cardiac Consultant focuses on making patient data easy to understand, setting it apart from existing risk calculators. Patients can interact with Cardiac Consultant to see how factors such as age and family history combine with their lifestyle choices to affect heart health.

The app connects patients to their personal health data located in Cernerâs electronic health record system. The tool uses [SMART on FHIRÂ®Â®](https://smarthealthit.org/), a modern healthcare IT standard which allows healthcare systems to exchange data seamlessly and securely. Asymmetrik partnered with Mile Two to develop the app, which was recently chosen as a finalist in Cernerâs Code App Challenge, a national competition honoring innovative new healthcare apps.
