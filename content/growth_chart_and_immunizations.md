<div data-reactid="39" style="color: rgb(67, 80, 101); font-family: "Open Sans", sans-serif; font-size: 16px;"><div data-reactid="40">Growth Chart app has been designed and developed for parents and pediatricians. The app provides a visual view of child’s growth, which allows for parents and pediatricians to understand growth data easily. The data on the chart is presented in metric units (kg, cm). This app utilizes two growth charts based on CDC recommendations:

\- World Health Organization (WHO) growth chart (length, weight and head circumference) for infants and children ages 0 to 2 years.

\- Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) growth chart (height and weight) for children 2 years and older.

In addition to growth chart information, child's immunizations can also be viewed, which makes it’s easier to track immunization history while reviewing child’s growth over time.
