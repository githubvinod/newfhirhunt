Built by physicians for physicians and their patients, the HealthDecision software suite currently contains tools that improve decisions about treating cardiovascular risk (statins, tobacco), atrial fibrillation (anticoagulation), osteoporosis (bisphosphonates) and screening for lung and breast cancers. The HealthDecision platform is integrated into the cliniciansâ€™ standard workflow within the EHR; incorporates the latest medical guidelines and performs complex risk calculations; and documents shared decision making, which is increasingly required for reimbursement. Based on patient-specific data, the platform provides a personalized risk assessment, visually depicting the harms and benefits of each medical option for easier comprehension of risk. For administrative purposes, HealthDecision can provide clinician usage data to support quality metrics, billing, and care optimization.</span>
