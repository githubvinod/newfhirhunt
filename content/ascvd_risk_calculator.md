<div data-reactid="39" style="color: rgb(67, 80, 101); font-family: "Open Sans", sans-serif; font-size: 16px;"><div data-reactid="40">Based upon the 2013 ACC/AHA Guideline on the Assessment of Cardiovascular Risk and their Guideline on the Treatment of Blood Cholesterol to Reduce Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Risk in Adults, this application allows users to estimate a 10-year and/or lifetime risk score for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). These scores are estimated based upon Pooled Cohort Equations and lifetime risk prediction tools. The application presents relevant patient vitals and labs that factor into the estimated score(s), with a user-friendly display of current and lowest possible risks in a bar-graph setting.

Furthermore, the application allows users to simulate a potential reduction in the current risk score down towards the lowest possible risk through a variety of risk-diminishing actions that a provider can discuss with the patient. These risk-reducing actions are further explained in a recommendations view that allow providers to elaborate on methods to lower ASCVD risk, and for patients to easily understand what can be done to improve their estimated risk score.
