<div data-reactid="39" style="color: rgb(67, 80, 101); font-family: "Open Sans", sans-serif; font-size: 16px;"><div data-reactid="40">ClinDat is designed with two interfaces specifically optimized for the distinct needs of patients and physicians. For patients, we implemented an easy-to-use interface to complete standardized questionnaires useful for monitoring rheumatic disease. For physicians, ClinDat provides several clinical checklists (including a visual homunculus) and computes several useful rheumatologic scores.

ClinDat provides simplified electronic entry for patients to complete MDHAQ/RAPID3 (multidimensional health assessment questionnaire/routine assessment of patient index data), for quantitative medical history data, which is useful to monitor patients with all rheumatic diseases including treat-to-target in rheumatoid arthritis (RA).

ClinDat also provides a RheuMetric checklist for physicians, with 28 joint electronic scoring using a table or homunculus, and computes a disease activity score (DAS28), simplified disease activity score (SDAI), clinical disease activity score (CDAI), and/or RAPID3, indicating high, moderate, low, activity, or remission.
