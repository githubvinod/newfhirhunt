The Lush Group is positioned to develop <span title="FHIR® is the registered trademark of HL7 and is used with the permission of HL7">FHIR<sup>®</sup></span>-based apps and interfaces for organizations to provide clinical information internally and to exchange data across organizational boundaries. Many of the <span title="FHIR® is the registered trademark of HL7 and is used with the permission of HL7">FHIR<sup>®</sup></span>-based apps being developed today focus on presenting clinical information to providers, helping to provide insight and improve care. As we continue to evolve, we need to empower patients to better understand their health data, and engage patients in managing their own health and well-being.

This application demonstrates connecting with multiple EMRs to provide clinical data for a specified patient. The use case shows a physician searching his/her patients and displaying the clinical record. It could also be used by a patient. The Lush SMART App runs on iOS, Android and Windows Phone devices. It can be restyled to change branding or alter the UX. Lush Group is working with clients to develop clinical functionality built upon the core clinical patient data.
