MyLegacy is a FHIR® app designed for use by patients and their primary care doctors to capture a standardized family health history and determine genetic risk. This app was developed by the Genomics Institute of the Cleveland Clinic and (currently) incorporates proprietary algorithms to risk stratify for 12 manageable familial and hereditary genetic conditions, representing the total sum of genetic and genomic factors combined with environmental factors. This web based app provides the physician with a family pedigree and detailed risk analysis within the EMR, enabling a systematic method for interpreting genetic information. Additional algorithms are scheduled to be added. 

MyLegacy is built on Microsoft’s cloud and leverages the latest technology to provide a secure and scalable solution for managing personalized family health history data. Patients can access MyLegacy from the comfort of their own home, documenting their family health history at their own pace. Ultimately, this improves the quality of information and provides critical decision support to physicians in-line with patient care. 

MyLegacy leverages both the SMART® and HL7® FHIR®® open standards for seamless communication with Cerner’s Electronic Health Record and patient portal. This enables application level integration, allowing both patients and clinicians access to their Cerner accounts for authentication and authorization, securely sharing information between the patient record and the My Legacy application. This model improves the user experience and ensures key patient information is coordinated within the patient record. The best patient information is available in time for clinical decisions and is accessible at the point of care.
