Sandbox, created by a provider-vendor consortium, is a personal instance of a SMART on FHIR® platform in the cloud complete with tools and sample data to help developers build and test health apps. Reduce time to integrate with commercial HSPC and/or SMART on FHIR® capable platforms (such as EHRs, HIEs, etc.)
