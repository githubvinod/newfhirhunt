The FHIR®-enabled ePRISM app from Health Outcomes Sciences allows clients to automatically activate predictive risk models within the routine flow of care. ePRISM breaks new ground in providing clinicians the means to risk stratify individual patients in real time using data already recorded in the EHR and other interfaced systems. The ability to personalize care and engage in shared decision-making is heightened, leading to better clinical and financial outcomes. Plus, using FHIR® means the bulk of the IT burden typically associated with implementing a new technology solution is virtually eliminated.
