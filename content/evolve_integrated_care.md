Evolve Integrated Care is cloud-only, multi-tenant platform designed from the ground up around FHIRÂ®, enabling healthcare organisations to automate clinical care pathways and seamlessly integrate with the system of record. It uses FHIRÂ® as main data repository for all applications to build on the Evolve platform and in addition also use FHIRÂ® as the mechanism to exchange information with the relevant system of record. This FHIRÂ® based platform is used in both the UK and the NHS across 100 hospitals helping to automate a range of clinical care pathways including stroke, behavioural health and urgent care.
