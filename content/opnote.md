<div data-reactid="39" style="color: rgb(67, 80, 101); font-family: "Open Sans", sans-serif; font-size: 16px;"><div data-reactid="40">OpNote is accessed via a web browser and can be hosted by mTuitive or internally at a hospital or surgery center. Touch screen monitors and keyboards are utilized for the most efficient data input.

Rather than dictating the postoperative report, the surgeon uses an intuitive chooser on a touch screen monitor that accesses the appropriate procedure codes and instinctively produces available diagnosis codes. A personalized, defaulted postoperative report is dynamically produced. In the final step, the surgeon reviews and electronically signs the report once and is done. Physicians won't have to waste time reviewing, correcting and waiting for their transcribed reports. The final report is printed out on the spot or saved directly to the medical records at the hospital or surgical center.
