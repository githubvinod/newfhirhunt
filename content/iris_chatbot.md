Iris Chatbot enables a patient to schedule a doctor’s appointment and order medication refills from within Facebook Messenger or iMessage. Appointments, Med Refills from your Favorite Messaging App using <span title="FHIR® is the registered trademark of HL7 and is used with the permission of HL7">FHIR<sup>®</sup></span>.

People use messaging apps like Facebook Messenger and iMessage on a daily (constant?) basis, much, much more compared to email or using a separate mobile app (or patient portal) specific to a hospital or pharmacy. We believe patients are much more engaged with their care provider if they can perform basic administrative tasks (scheduling, ordering medications, or viewing lab results) from within their mobile messaging apps that they already use heavily every day.

Iris has the “smarts” to converse with a patient to get all their pertinent details to schedule an appointment or order medication refills, and on the backend, it makes use of <span title="FHIR® is the registered trademark of HL7 and is used with the permission of HL7">FHIR<sup>®</sup></span> API calls to interact with the EHR to schedule the appointment or request medication refill.

Working with our development partners Leapfrog Technology and Expresiv Studios, we have developed a prototype implementation of Iris, and we are looking for beta customers/partners. Contact us at <contact@openi.org> if you are interested to make this work for your patients.
