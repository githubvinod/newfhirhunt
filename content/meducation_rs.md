Meducation® is accessed from within EHR workflow and converts patient's complex medication instructions into plain language for low health literate and limited English proficient patients. Low health literate individuals are more likely to take their medicines incorrectly, be hospitalized, mismanage chronic conditions and visit the emergency room.

Meducation reduces medication errors and improves medication adherence by providing actionable Sig-based instructions. Meducation is not static patient education material (PEM). Meducation uses the patient's drug and SIG information fro Integrated with your EHR or Pharmacy system, Meducation uses a patient's medication and SIG information to create personalized medication instructions that can be delivered to patients printed, or as part of their discharge documents, without interrupting clinical workflow. Meducation has proven to increase medication adherence, improve patient satisfaction and reduce hospital readmission rates, particularly for Low Health Literate and Limited English Proficient patients.
