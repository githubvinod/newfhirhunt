What would access to analytics, directly in the workflow of the EHR, do for your clinicians?

• Inform decision making, enabling improved outcomes?

• Speed decision making, having information seamlessly available?

• Focus decision making, efficiently using clinician time?

Embedded analytics would do these three things and more.

The SMART Analytics Adapter by Qlik enables electronic health records (EHR) software users to embed Qlik Sense® analytics directly into workflows. This allows your clinical decision makers to layer and view relevant information, uncover new insights, and use those insights to promote better clinical and business decisions.

The SMART Analytics Adapter functions like other APIs – it connects your EHR and Qlik, integrating reports, scorecards and dashboards within the EHR. Clinicians can now seamlessly navigate across patient records, view practice pattern trends and clinical variations – all with a single login.
