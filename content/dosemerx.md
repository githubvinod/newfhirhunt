DoseMeRx is the world's first easy-to-use precision dosing software designed for clinicians to improve dosing accuracy and patient outcomes by predicting the optimal individualized dose of medications to safely reach therapeutic concentrations quicker.

Using SMART® and FHIR® technologies, DoseMeRx extracts patient characteristics, dose administered, renal function and previous response to therapy. Leveraging clinically validated pharmacokinetic drug models, DoseMeRx models how each patient is responding to therapy from as-little-as one assay, taking into account individual variability in genes, environment and lifestyle to accurately calculate an individualized dose to reach a therapeutic target.

Reduce adverse events and improve patient outcomes, while decreasing time spent on dose adjustments and the number of assays required to optimize a patient's dose for numerous antibiotics including vancomycin and the aminoglycosides, as well as immunosuppressants, chemotherapeutic agents, and many more.
