The Asymmetrik Extensible Server Framework for Healthcare allows organizations to build secure, interoperable solutions that can aggregate and expose healthcare resources via a common HL7® <span title="FHIR® is the registered trademark of HL7 and is used with the permission of HL7">FHIR<sup>®</sup></span>®-compatible REST API. This server framework currently supports both DSTU2 (1.0.2) and STU3 (3.0.1) simultaneously. You can decide to support both or just one by editing the configuration.

The framework defines a core server, `node-fhir-server-core`, a simple, secure Node.js module built according to the <span title="FHIR® is the registered trademark of HL7 and is used with the permission of HL7">FHIR<sup>®</sup></span> specification and compliant with the [US Core](http://www.hl7.org/fhir/us/core/) implementation.

For an example implementation using MongoDB, please refer to our Github repository that we used for the ONC <span title="FHIR® is the registered trademark of HL7 and is used with the permission of HL7">FHIR<sup>®</sup></span> Secure API Server Showdown Challenge, <https://github.com/Asymmetrik/node-fhir-server-mongo>.
