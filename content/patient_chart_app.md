<span style="font-family: Arial;">Patient Chart app allows users to view a person's medical record on a local device (laptop, tablet or mobile phone) using OAuth 2.0 or Basic Auth (for system account only) framework that enables the app to obtain access to the medical record from the <span title="FHIR速 is the registered trademark of HL7 and is used with the permission of HL7">FHIR<sup>速</sup></span> server.  
  
This app is beneficial for both physicians and patients who like to view a longitudinal patient record by retrieving data from multiple sources, such as EMR, HIE, etc. The app pulls Allergies, Conditions, Procedures, Immunizations, Medications, Family History, Vital Signs, Lab Results and Radiology Reports from the <span title="FHIR速 is the registered trademark of HL7 and is used with the permission of HL7">FHIR<sup>速</sup></span> server and displays information within specific sections. This app allows sharing of data in a seamless, fast and secure manner unlike how data gets shared between physicians and their patients currently using fax or paper.</span>
