My Care Guide is a mobile app for iPhone and iPad that puts you at the center of defining and participating in a person-centered care plan with a long-term view for wellness guided by your personal team of doctors, therapists, and other caregivers. My Care Guide is based on three complementary technologies that are uniquely suited for putting the person at the center of wellness and care planning: HL7 FHIR® standard for EHR interoperability, CDS Hooks for providing real-time guidance on your progress, and the Apple CareKit™ framework. Person-centered care for women, with initial focus on maternity care, is the first clinical application for My Care Guide app pilot testing.

&gt; *My Care Guide* enables you to create and share personalized goals and activity plans, and receive guidance for wellness and health care that put ***you*** at the center supported by ***your*** care team. *My Care Guide* also enables your health care team members to share their care plans with you, all in the palm of your hand on your iPhone!

*My Care Guide* improves care and care planning with the following capabilities:

- Share care plans and progress assessments using the [HL7 FHIR®](http://hl7.org/fhir) standard
- Collect and share [Patient Reported Outcomes (PRO)](https://www.qualityforum.org/Patient-Reported_Outcomes.aspx), including:
  - Health-related quality of life (including functional status)
  - Symptoms and symptom burden (e.g. pain, fatigue)
  - Health behaviors (e.g., smoking, diet, exercise)
- Collect and share health data from your wearable and connected devices that are focused on your goals and care plans
  - e.g. your care activities include measuring blood pressure if you have hypertension, or blood glucose if you are diabetic
- Receive guidance that helps you achieve your goals
  - Progress assessments on your goals (e.g. weight loss, blood pressure, blood glucose, etc.)
  - Care plan activity tips, suggestions, warnings, reminders, etc.
  - We will build an ecosystem of partner organizations that provide condition-specific guidance, integrated into *My Care Guide* using the [CDS Hooks](http://cds-hooks.org/) standard.
