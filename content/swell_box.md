Swellbox includes a free, lifetime health account that students can use to aggregate their health information from anywhere on campus. We organize confusing medical data into an intuitive + sleek timeline and pledge lifetime access for students after graduation. A simple, secure and free, lifetime health account that students can use to collect their health information from anywhere on campus and have forever.

Swellbox can be used as a standalone platform or can be directly integrated into the university health system for a more seamless experience.
