The Asymmetrik Extensible Server Framework for Healthcare allows organizations to build secure, interoperable solutions that can aggregate and expose healthcare resources via a common HL7® FHIR®-compatible REST API. This server framework currently supports both DSTU2 (1.0.2) and STU3 (3.0.1) simultaneously. You can decide to support both or just one by editing the configuration.

The framework defines a core server, node-fhir-server-core, a simple, secure Node.js module built according to the FHIR® specification and compliant with the US Core implementation.

For an example implementation using MongoDB, please refer to our Github repository that we used for the ONC FHIR® Secure API Server Showdown Challenge, [https://github.com/Asymmetrik/node-fhir-server-mongo](https://github.com/Asymmetrik/node-fhir-server-mongo).
