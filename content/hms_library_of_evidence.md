The goal of the HMS Library of Evidence is to create a provider-led, sustainable, public repository of medical evidence to enable and promote the broad and consistent practice of evidence-based medicine, with the goals of improving the quality of care and patient experience while reducing waste. The Libraryâ€™s evidence grading methodology is based on the 2009 version of the Oxford Centre for Evidence-based Medicine (CEBM). Recommendations from public domain sources, such as peer reviewed literature, local best practices, and professional society guidelines are displayed as Health-IT consumable clinical logic.

The app takes patient-specific clinical data, and provides evidence-based decision rules to guide appropriate use of medical imaging.
