The MedTrue application integrates different medication data sources to assist with medication reconciliation and adherence, resulting in a patient- and healthcare team-verified medication list. The application is embedded directly within the electronic medical record (EMR) and in the healthcare providerâs workflow for optimal use of clinical and patient-reported data during patient appointments. The application is also accessible to patients from the convenience of their home. MedTrue uses SMART on FHIRÂ® so the application can be used in healthcare systems anywhere.
