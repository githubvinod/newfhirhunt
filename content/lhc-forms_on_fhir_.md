<div><div>LHC-Forms (a.k.a. "LForms") is a widget that generates input forms, based on definition files, for Web-based applications or to integrate into electronic health records (EHRs), personal health records (PHRs), and mobile health apps. The input forms support repeating sections and questions, hiding and showing questions via skip logic based on the user's answers to other questions, coded answer lists, scored answers, and more.
